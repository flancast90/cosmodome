### Info
Cosmodome is the joint creation of @flancast90 and @ziemniakbiznesu, which is similar to slither.io and moomoo.io . After a few months of successful growth, since both devs had little time to add more features, it is now open source here! Feel free to fork/pull on the code. The game uses a custom-built engine utilising socket.io and expressjs to implement multiplayer capabilities.

### Gameplay
The point of the game is to kill players with your line, and not be killed from someone elses line. Your line can be extended with powerups, which also make gameplay more dynamic with other features such as invisbility and superspeed! In addition to all of this, there is a functional leaderboard and chat, along with AI players to make gameplay more dynamic. Look out for the cheatcodes which can add some "special" features to the game!
