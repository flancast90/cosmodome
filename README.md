# TODO
1. Fix viewport in index.html (look up Canvas Viewport)
2. Move client-side js from index.html ``<script>`` tags to ``assets/game.js``
3. Move client styling from index.html ``<style>`` tags to ``assets/stylesheet,css``
5. Finally, add Facebook and Google login option, as well as connect to PostgreSQL or MySQL to store stats and user info (build mailing list)
6. Release code to public, as well as work to get funding to host node server on custom domain (look into Heroku paid teirs of data) (maybe buy cosmonot.io domain, if not taken)
